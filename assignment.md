# Assignment

## Brief

In this assignment, you will use whatever you have learned in the lesson to make an attempt to create two other popular navigation components:

1. [Tab Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation)
1. [Drawer Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-based-navigation)

Recall the concept where each `Screen` lives within a `Stack`, and the `Stack` within a `Container`. In a Tab Navigation, each screen can function as a `Stack` that contains multiple `Screens` within it. In a Drawer Navigation, it is much straightforward.

This assignment will expose you to the Tab and Drawer navigation, which will be helpful for the scoping of your project by giving you an idea how it works.
